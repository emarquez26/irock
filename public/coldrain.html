            <h2>Coldrain</h2>
            <p>coldrain was formed in 2007 in Nagoya and consists of 5 members: vocalist Masato, bassist RxYxO (Ryo), drummer Katsuma, and guitarists Y.K.C (Yokochi) and Sugi. The band gained their first followers from performing as a local band in their home-town while distributing demo discs after each performance. Shortly thereafter, the band started becoming well known despite their songs all being sung in English by half-American singer Masato.
            About a year after coldrain formed, they were offered and later signed a major contract with VAP, after which the band released its debut maxi single "Fiction" on November 5, 2008. They then set off for their first nationwide tour and played in 30 venues across Japan.
            After the tour, the group released their next maxi single: "8AM". The limited edition included a DVD which featured the music video of the title song and three live videos: "Fiction", "Painting", and "Come Awake". "8AM" was also used as a theme song to the anime series Hajime no Ippo: New Challenger. 2009 saw their first performance at the Summer Sonic Festival. In October, they released their first album "Final Destination" and embarked on another successful sold-out nationwide tour.
            The band released their EP "Nothing Lasts Forever" on June 23, 2010. One of the songs, "Weâ€™re Not Alone", was used as an opening theme of the anime series Rainbow: Nisha Rokubo no Shichinin.
            Another song, "Die Tomorrow", was used in the Pro Evolution Soccer 2011 soundtrack.
            On 30 November 2012, in a statement on their official website, coldrain announced the release of their third studio album, scheduled for spring 2013. "The Revelation", produced by David Bendeth, was released on April 17, 2013. They collaborated with Bendeth for the second time: indeed he also worked with them on their second EP "Through Clarity".
            On December 2013 coldrain signed with Raw Power Management. This allows the band to perform for the first time in Europe alongside British band Bullet for My Valentine in 2014 and to release a new album worldwide on the same year</p>
